# deeplearning

Studying and playing with AI.

* [GTP to GPT](gtp_gpt): training a LM on guitar tablature.
* Path to GPT:
	* [karpathy](karpathy): following [Andrej Karpathy's course](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero) from a primitive language model to GPT.
	* [picogpt](picogpt): one step from Karpathy's course to industry ML: using `torch.nn` instead of implementing models manually.
	* [hipogpt](hipogpt): another step further: using HuggingFace `transformers` library to train.
	* [pretgpt](pretgpt): fine-tuning a pre-trained GPT2.
	* TODO: try [parameter-efficient fine-tuning](https://huggingface.co/blog/peft) for the most efficient implementation.
* [scribepod](scribepod): forking and playing with scribepod to generate a podcast about bioinformatics papers.
